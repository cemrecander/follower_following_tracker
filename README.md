# Follower-Following Tracker
This Instagram bot keeps track of who is following and who is following you. It unfollows anyone who does not follow you back. If the user has more than 3000 followers, you will be asked whether you want to unfollow or not.

Please save your username and password in parallel pairs in a text file called "credentials.txt."

```bash
username
password
```

Install the instagrapi library before using the bot.

```bash
pip install instagrapi
```
